## General Information

For this project, I wanted to create a script that could be automated with Airplane.dev that would update my Instagram bio every morning with a random item from an array of 400 "occupations" my siblings and I created.

## Technologies Used

- Airplane v0.2.38
- Instagram Private API v1.45.3

## Features

Airplane.dev to automate custom script.


## Project Status

Version 1: _complete as of 10/15/23_ 

## Issues

- None at the moment. Decided against using it so as not to get my account banned for automation.
